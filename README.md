# Frontend code exercise
Demo: https://code-demo-five.vercel.app/people

This exercise is the take-home portion of a coding interview. The task was to implement the sketch designs for a people list page.

My implementation is on the [`implement-people-list`](https://github.com/ruridge/code-demo/tree/implement-people-list) branch
